    <p>Glo was created to solve problems. Namely, these problems are:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>I’m new to skincare, and I don’t know where to start.</li>
      <li>How can I trust if products really do what they say they do?</li>
      <li>I love skincare, and I’d love one platform where I can learn more about it. </li>

  <!-- The Solution-->
  <section class="glo_solution">
    <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>The Solution</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Glo is a destination for skincare enthusiast to connect and share knowledge. As it is not connected to any skincare brand or cosmetic company, it is impartial. This fosters a sense of trust as well as community between users.</p>

  <!-- The Process-->
  <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Glo grew from a very broad client request. Initially we were approached by our client who wanted to develop a cloud storage and organisation app. While there are many big players in this field, the client believed there was scope for a new product if it met the needs of a particular audience. The client wanted the app to offer various features (saving online content, organising content, creating content and uploading content) as well as a collaboration/sharing aspect. I was involved as the designer for this project, and worked on it from start to finish. <br> <br>As we moved through the design process we realised that a traditional cloud storage service was not ideal, as the market is saturated. So we turned our attention to niche markets, the problems they presented that needed solutions.</p>

  <!-- Comp Analysis-->
  <section class="glo_comp">
    <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The research process began with competitive analysis. As we were still considering traditional cloud storage, we analysed Pinterest, Google Drive and Dropbox.<br> <br>The analysis made it clear that the traditional cloud storage market is a tough one to break into. From this point, the focus moved from traditional cloud storage to trying to identify a niche market.<br><br>Following discussions with the client, skincare emerged as a particular interest, and one which we examined further in the next step.</p>

  <!-- User Research-->

    <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Having defined the scope slightly through competitive analysis, it was now time to learn about the users. A survey was compiled via Google Forms, and disseminated to various individuals. Users were asked about their cloud storage habits, as well as their interest in a potential skincare app.</p>

    <h4>User Personas</h4>
    <br>
    <p>User research helped us learn more about our users, but in order to help avoid scope creep and assist with further development, it was crucial to create user personas.<br><br>Four personas were crafted, each focused on a different facet of the skincare app.</p>

    <p>Having gathered the research and crafted the personas, the next step was to identify the user stories and prioritise them. This allowed us to ensure we were  at the very least developing a MVP (minimally viable product).</p>

    <p>Furthering the information architecture process, user flows were mapped out for the high priority user stories. While mapping these flows some medium priority stories came to be included as well. The user flows were crucial for the next step - wireframing.</p>

    <p>While usability testing on the wireframes was carried out, the work started on developing the brand. This encompassed the app name, colours, logo and look & feel. We started with the brand emotions. With these identified we were able to move forward with a mood board, and logo iterations.</p>

We tested preferences on the homepage design, the dashboard and the product listing. Once the final iterations were submitted and approved, we performed further usability testing. </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Looking at the final prototype, we can state that the problems we were confronted with have been solved. Glo is an elegant solution, one that meets the client brief and also has room for growth in the future. An e-commerce aspect should be investigated, as it could be a source for potential earnings.</p>
