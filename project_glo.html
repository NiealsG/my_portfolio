    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>Glo was created to solve problems. Namely, these problems are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I’m new to skincare, and I don’t know where to start.</li>
      <li>How can I trust if products really do what they say they do?</li>

    <p>Glo is a destination for skincare enthusiast to connect and share knowledge. As it is not connected to any skincare brand or cosmetic company, it is impartial. This fosters a sense of trust as well as community between users.</p>

  <!-- The Process-->
  <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>Glo grew from a very broad client request. Initially we were approached by our client who wanted to develop a cloud storage and organisation app. While there are many big players in this field, the client believed there was scope for a new product if it met the needs of a particular audience. The client wanted the app to offer various features (saving online content, organising content, creating content and uploading content) as well as a collaboration/sharing aspect. I was involved as the designer for this project, and worked on it from start to finish. <br> <br>As we moved through the design process we realised that a traditional cloud storage service was not ideal, as the market is saturated. So we turned our attention to niche markets, the problems they presented that needed solutions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box_orange">
  </div>

  <!-- Comp Analysis-->
  <section class="glo_comp">
    <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>The research process began with competitive analysis. As we were still considering traditional cloud storage, we analysed Pinterest, Google Drive and Dropbox.
    <div class="glo_comp_pics">
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox"></a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/" target="_blank"><img src="images/google_drive.png" alt="Google Drive"></a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/pinterest.png" alt="Pinterest"></a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Dropbox is aimed at working professionals, students and personal users (much like Google Drive). It is available on multiple platforms, and offers up to 2GB of storage for free.</p>
      <img class="screenshot" src="images/dropbox_ss.png" alt="Dropbox Mobile Screenshot">
        <h5>Screenshot of Dropbox on mobile</h5>
    <p>A summary of the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis has been included below.</p>
    <div class="glo_comp_list">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy installation process.</li>
          <li>Strong awareness among internet users.</li>
          <li>Simple design and offers a user-friendly experience.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The free version of Dropbox offers less storage space than some competitors.</li>
          <li>Majority of Dropbox users use the free plan. For continued revenue and growth the paid plan needs more users.</li>
          <li>Concerns have been raised regarding the security of customer data.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>As the world continues to move increasingly online and virtual, there is a growing need for cloud-based storage.</li>
          <li>Could increase security by offering zero-knowledge encryption.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Threats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Lots of competitive alternatives available.</li>
          <li>Some of the privacy practices raise concerns.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>As one of the leaders online, Google Drive offers an easy and free option of cloud storage and file sharing. Ideal for both individuals and teams, it is aimed at users already using the Google suite of products</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/googledrive_ss.png" alt="Google Drive Mobile Screenshot">
          <h5>Screenshot of Google Drive on mobile</h5>
      <div class="glo_comp_list">
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Users already familiar with other Google products (Gmail etc) will easily transition into using Google Drive.</li>
            <li>The free plan offers more storage than some competitors.</li>
            <li>Usage is intuitive.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Requires a Gmail address.</li>
            <li>The storage offer with the free plan is shared with the user’s Gmail and Google Calendar storage.</li>
            <li>Difficult to share files directly from the desktop sync folder.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Grow to offer a referral programme, like Dropbox, where users can access more free storage by recruiting new members.</li>
            <li>Could increase security by offering zero-knowledge encryption.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Threats</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lots of competitive alternatives available.</li>
            <li>Security and privacy concerns.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <p>Pinterest has been described as a "catalogue of ideas" that inspires users to "go out and do that thing", rather than as an image-based social network. According to research, it’s primarily used by women who are in “discovery mode”.</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/pinterest_ss.png" alt="Pinterest Mobile Screenshot">
          <h5>Screenshot of Pinterest on mobile</h5>
      <div class="glo_comp_list">
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Offers a visually stimulating alternative to traditional internet searches.</li>
            <li>Paid ads/pin sponsorship is now offered to businesses, making Pinterest a strong marketing tool.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>May be viewed as being primarily aimed to women (gender bias).</li>
            <li>Due to its open nature, pins may be spam or faulty links.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Potential for e-commerce integration.</li>
            <li>Potential to increase the credibility of the site by offering increased protection against scammers & spam.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Threats</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Spam pins may affect the credibility of the site.</li>
            <li>Scammers have used Pinterest to draw in victims to defraud.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

    <p>The analysis made it clear that the traditional cloud storage market is a tough one to break into. From this point, the focus moved from traditional cloud storage to trying to identify a niche market.</p>
    <p>Following discussions with the client, skincare emerged as a particular interest, and one which we examined further in the next step.</p>

With the changes in place, users had no problem completing the task.</p>
