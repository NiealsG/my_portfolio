        <h2>Hi! I’m Daniela, and I’m a UX/UI Designer.</h2>
        <p>As a remote designer, I’m passionate about <strong>travel and solutions.</strong> But I wasn’t always in this field. In the past I’ve been involved in fashion merchandising, studied psychology to a post-graduate level, run a factory and was involved with the FIFA World Cup. <strong>So what brought me to the world of product design?</strong></p>

        <p>Have you ever felt that itch, <strong>that uncomfortable feeling that something in your life is just not right?</strong> Home doesn’t feel like somewhere you’re meant to be, and you feel stagnant and uninspired?</p>
        <p>That was me.</p>
        <p>Late 2018 I was killing time browsing Buzzfeed, and came across an article about Remote Year. Remote Year is a company which organises various travelling itineraries for groups of remote workers. Itineraries vary from 4 months to a year, but essentially they all involve working remotely from a different country every month. <strong>This sounded amazing.</strong> I read about it on Wednesday, and by Saturday I had paid my deposit. I was running a factory at the time with family - not really the type of career you can do remotely. But I was going to make it work for 4 months. It just felt like something I needed to do.</p>
        <blockquote>
          “ Looking back, it was the best decision I could have made. “
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once I embarked on the Remote Year trip, I met all kinds of people working in all types of careers. It really was eye-opening. During our skill-sharing seminars I found myself repeatedly <strong>drawn to one person</strong> - I found her work fascinating. <strong>She was a UX/UI Designer.</strong> This was my first time really learning about this area of design, and I was intrigued.</p>
        <p>As I continued to learn from her, and learn about what she did, I realised that <strong>this was something I was passionate about.</strong> With a background in psychology I’ve always enjoyed puzzling over why people do the things they do. That, combined with a love for creating things, and being a natural problem solver, UX/UI Design just fit. <strong>It felt comfortable and exciting. It felt right.</strong></p>
        <p>Furthermore, she was a fully remote worker. She had been travelling the globe for the past year, and had no plans to stop. This sounded right up my alley. I came to realise that I’d been feeling extremely stuck in my hometown. Travel had always been important to me, but I hadn’t quite realised that I could <strong>combine work and travel in quite this manner.</strong> Remote work was calling to me. And Design was the perfect industry that would meet my interests and abilities, and allow me to be location-independent.<br><br>Having discovered the world of Design, I grew more passionate about it the more I learnt about it. At the crux of it, <strong>design is what allows the world to continue.</strong> A poorly designed traffic intersection can result in countless car accidents. A badly structured school course can mean a failed grade.</p>
        <blockquote>
          “ Design is the skeleton on which great ideas grow. “
        </blockquote>
        <p>Poor design is not just frustrating and counter-productive, it’s dangerous. It stifles creativity and results in goals not being achieved. <br>Great design is often not noticed, but bad design feels like nails scraping a chalkboard. While that may be frustrating, I believe it’s simply the nature of design. We humans are funny things. We expect the world to work. We expect things to make sense. In fact when they don’t, we have an arsenal of psychological tricks to make ourselves think that things make sense. For the most part, <strong>good design empowers us to keep evolving, keep creating and keep innovating.</strong> It allows our minds to relax and focus.</p>
        <p>But for some of us, it’s the bad design which inspires. We see something broken, and we have a yearning to fix it. And I believe that is what separates designers and users. <strong>Designers see bad design as an opportunity to improve something.</strong> Users see bad design as a stumbling block. So as Designers it’s our duty to remove these blocks, and open the path for others to continue the journey.</p>
