  <section class="glo_problem">
    <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>Free.Fi was created to help remote workers. Specifically, the following issues were addressed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I need a free workspace:</strong> A certain portion of the remote work force may not be interested in paying for a subscription to a professional co-working office, or may require an appropriate space to work from for a couple of hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Is a coffee shop suited to working remotely from?:</strong> Not all coffee shops are appropriate for the remote worker. The noise levels may be too high, the wifi quality may be poor, or a myriad of other concerns. If a worker is new to the concept of remote working, or new to a city, they may not have yet identified suitable options.</li>

    <p>The research process began with competitive analysis. We examined 3 websites and apps which helped remote workers find co-working spaces - OOTD, Coworker and Workfrom. Below is a summary of the </p>
    <p>A summary of the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis for each competitor has been included below.</p>

      <h5>Screenshot of OOTD on mobile</h5>
    <p>OOTD is an app aimed at helping remote workers discover and save non-office work spaces near them. There is also a localised chat feature to connect users.</p>

    <div class="glo_comp_list">
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All nearby locations are listed, so even if there are no ‘discovered’ locations near the user, they can still locate a workspace.</li>
          <li>Users are able to rate locations.</li>
          <li>Simple design and offers a user-friendly experience.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The symbols shown on the  search function are confusing.</li>
          <li>As it’s a new app, depending on a user’s location there may be a lack of ‘discovered’ locations.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Potential to grow the number of ‘discovered’ listings.</li>
          <li>Potential to expand to include a website.</li>

            <li>Easy-to-use website.</li>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Listings can be added by any user, so quality of information and entries may vary.</li>
            <li>There are icons displayed in the header on the website, but the purpose of these icons is not immediately understood.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Potential to offer bookings directly through the website/app.</li>
            <li>Potential to include information about fees for paid working spaces.</li>

    <p>Overall Coworker offered the most comprehensive solution, except that free locations were not included. This highlights a gap in the market - there is space for a similar offering that focuses on free working spaces.</p>

      <h4>Branding</h4>
      <p>While usability testing on the wireframes was carried out, the work started on developing the brand. This encompassed the app name, colours, logo brand emotions, mood board, logo iterations and style guide.</p>
      <h3>The Name & Logo</h3>
      <p>The name “Free.Fi” was conceived. It was born from the concept of “WiFi” and “Freedom” - two elements that are extremely important to remote workers.</p>
      <p>The Free.Fi logo mark was conceptualised by incorporating the WiFi symbol and “i” from Free.Fi. It’s simple, clear and fuss-free, just like Free.Fi.</p>

      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>Usability testing was carried out on the hi-fi mockup prototype. Participants were asked to perform three tasks, each a high priority user story. These were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Finding a workspace near me</li>
          <li>Saving a workspace to access later</li>
          <li>Read the reviews of a workspace</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Four tests were carried out in person. In each case, the respondents struggled with the second task. Initially the design used a bookmark icon, which was to be clicked on to save the listing. None of the respondents easily identified the bookmark icon as a method for saving. Due to this struggle, the design was changed. A ‘save’ button replaced the bookmark icon.</p>

  <section class="glo_conclusion">
    <div class="bodywithmargins">
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>When looking at the problems we were confronted with at the beginning of the project, we can say that the final prototype solves these issues. Free.Fi offers an elegant and functional option for remote workers to locate free workspaces near them. There is also room for growth in the future - the app could be expanded to include an option to book with the coffee shops via the app. Also there could be a message board or chat room, so that remote workers could communicate directly with each other.</p>
